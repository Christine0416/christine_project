The python script covid_run_Figure4.py should extract CovidSim from the GitHub repository, compile the code, and then run the simulations that will generate the data for Figure 4. The only complication is that you may need to modify the job submission script (covid-sim_batch_calib_UK.batch) for your own compute cluster.  

The other two python scripts (plot_CritCare_Fig4.py and plot_cumulDeaths_Fig4.ps) will generate the two Figure panels in Figure 4 and will save them as PDFs.
